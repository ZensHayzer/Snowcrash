We have a perl script that take an entry
We can inject code

Plus, we can see the 's', at owner permissions, that mean we can execute script with flag04 permissions
"-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar  5  2016 level04.pl"

In script we have :
"localhost:4747"

And an 'x' variable, so we can use curl to send our injection :
"curl localhost:4747?x=%3Bgetflag"

%3B mean ;, with this, we can send the command to the program with ';' to execute our getflag command after "echo"
